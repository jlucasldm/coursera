 Getting Started with PHP
Your application will be a single index.php file with some 
elements in HTML and some elements in PHP. This also verifies 
that you can do basic HTML and know how to use the 'pre' tag 
as well as understand how to switch between PHP and HTML when 
writing a PHP script. Make sure to save your screen shots JPG 
or PNG files and keep them less than 1MB. You must include the 
URL bar in all of your screen shots and the software must be 
running in your PHP server (i.e. file:// urls will not be 
accepted)

Please do your reviews of the other students submissions 
carefully. The actual points you award are less important 
than useful comments about what might be wrong and need fixing. 
You cannot re-submit your assignment unless the instructor 
allows you to resubmit.
